# A Supervised Approach to Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project implements a supervised machine learning approach for detecting credit card fraud. Leveraging various machine learning algorithms, the project aims to accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on historical transaction data.

## Features

* Supervised Learning: The project utilizes a supervised learning framework to train machine learning models on labeled transaction data.

* Flexible Model Selection: You can choose from a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to build and evaluate fraud detection models.

* Performance Evaluation: The project includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of each model.

## Requirements

*Python 3.x

*scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the script to preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Configuration

You can customize the project by modifying the following parameters in the code:

* Feature selection techniques

* Hyperparameter tuning options

* Data preprocessing steps

* Evaluation metrics

## Working

1. Load the credit card transaction dataset.

2. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and imbalance.

3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Train various machine learning models using the training data.

5. Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.

6. Select the best-performing model for credit card fraud detection.

## Acknowledgments

* The project utilizes scikit-learn, an open-source machine learning library in Python, for building and evaluating machine learning models.
